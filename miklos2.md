## Case Study From Our Research Lab

### Case Study From Our Research Lab
CEU MicroData and **MACROMANAGERS.eu** are economics research labs studying competitiveness, firm dynamics, trade and growth.

**Variety of data**: administrative registers, surveys, web-scraped data, commercial datasets. Typically not large, but complex.

**Diverse and evolving team**: 7 senior researchers, 4 research fellows, 20+ recent and 40+ past student affiliates.

### How We Use bead
Used since 2017 internally and when sharing data with others.

Saved about 600+ beads, two versions on average.

Interquartile range of bead sizes: 10 to 500 MB, largest is 23 GB.

Median time between saving new versions: 51 days.

### Practices We Adopted
_Everything_ is a bead: raw data, intermediate data, analysis sample, research results.

Never load data directly, from outside a bead

- Side product: always use relative paths

We don't often recompute everything, but nice to know we _could_.
